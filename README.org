* 42's FdF project (wireframe model)
[[./img/screenshot.png]]
This project aims to teach the basics of 3D graphics project in C, including window management, event handling, colors, textures, etc.
** Graphical library
To help us use the graphics of the computer, we use the MiniLibx library, which was developed internally.
** Used projection
For the mandatory part, we must display the maps using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection][isometric projection]] ([[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_isom%C3%A9trique][perspective isom√©trique]]). For this purpose and to handle bonuses (rotations, translations and zooms), I use the matrices rotation, translation & scale. To display the isometric projection, I just do rotations with corresponding angles (45 degrees on z then 35.264 degrees on x).

* Time spent
Predicted time was 60h, I spent 78h on the project (due to aborted techniques such as quaternions).
